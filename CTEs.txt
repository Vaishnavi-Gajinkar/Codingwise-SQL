CS1 - Operations wants to see how much revenue each vendor made on each market day to plan booth pricing.
Approach: Compute daily gross revenue per vendor (quantity Ã— cost_to_customer_per_qty) for all market dates

WITH gr AS (
    SELECT *, (cp.quantity*cp.cost_to_customer_per_qty) AS gross_rev from vendor_inventory vi join customer_purchases cp where cp.vendor_id=vi.vendor_id
    )
SELECT * from gr
